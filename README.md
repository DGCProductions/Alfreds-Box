# Alfreds-Box

Ludum Dare 46

Your crazy neighbor, Alfred the nut, asks you a favor to keep **IT alive**, which is in the box, from dying to the crazy robots from a different dimension. That itself explains why he is crazy. 

Shoot the robots from your window and keep **IT** alive.

But the true question is, who or what, is **IT**?
